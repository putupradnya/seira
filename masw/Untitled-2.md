This code finds the minimum and maximum values of a given array and then creates a new array with the values between the minimum and maximum. The new array includes the values of three different arrays (A, f, c). The np.abs() function takes the absolute value of each element in the given array. The np.where() function returns an array of indices where a given condition is true. The np.min() function returns the minimum value in an array. Finally, the .flatten() method returns a flattened one-dimensional copy of an array.
